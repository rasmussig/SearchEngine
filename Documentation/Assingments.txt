This codebase is a PoC searchengine that consist of multiple programs and a class library.

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION 

## NEW FEATURES (Version 2)

### Opgave 2: Enhanced Word Frequency Output
CHANGED FILES:
- indexer/DatabaseSqlite.cs: Added GetWordFrequencies() method
- indexer/App.cs: Modified to show word frequencies sorted by occurrence count

The indexer now shows word frequencies instead of just word IDs, with most frequent words first.
Instead of showing <word, id>, it now shows <word, id> - frequency_count

### Opgave 3: Case Sensitive Search Control
CHANGED FILES:
- Shared/Config.cs: Added CaseSensitive boolean property
- ConsoleSearch/Config.cs: Added wrapper for CaseSensitive property
- ConsoleSearch/App.cs: Added command handling for /casesensitive=on/off

Users can now control case sensitivity with commands:
- /casesensitive=on - enables case sensitive search
- /casesensitive=off - disables case sensitive search

### Opgave 4: Timestamp Display Control
CHANGED FILES:
- Shared/Config.cs: Added ViewTimeStamps boolean property
- ConsoleSearch/Config.cs: Added wrapper for ViewTimeStamps property  
- ConsoleSearch/App.cs: Added command handling for /timestamp=on/off and conditional timestamp display

Users can now control timestamp visibility with commands:
- /timestamp=on - shows indexing timestamps in search results
- /timestamp=off - hides indexing timestamps in search results

### Opgave 5: Configurable Search Results Limit
CHANGED FILES:
- Shared/Config.cs: Added MaxResults int? property (default 20, null = show all)
- ConsoleSearch/Config.cs: Added wrapper for MaxResults property
- ConsoleSearch/App.cs: Added command handling for /results=X or /results=all and dynamic result limiting

Users can now control the number of search results with commands:
- /results=X - shows X number of results (e.g., /results=15)
- /results=all - shows all available results
Default changed from 10 to 20 results per search.

### Opgave 6: Load Balancer for SearchAPI
CHANGED FILES:
- LoadBalancer/Controllers/SearchController.cs: Implements random load balancing with health checks
- LoadBalancer/Program.cs: ASP.NET Core setup with HttpClient support

A load balancer that distributes search requests across multiple SearchAPI instances.

FEATURES:
- Random load balancing strategy across healthy backend instances
- Health check endpoint (/api/Search/ping) to verify backend availability
- Automatic failover - only forwards to healthy backends
- Response headers showing which backend handled each request (X-LoadBalancer-Backend)

HOW TO TEST:
1. Start multiple SearchAPI instances on different ports:
   Terminal 1: id=SearchAPI_1 dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5281" (in SearchAPI folder)
   Terminal 2: id=SearchAPI_2 dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5282" (in SearchAPI folder)

2. Start LoadBalancer:
   Terminal 3: dotnet run (in LoadBalancer folder, runs on port 5280)

3. Check backend status:
   curl http://localhost:5280/api/Search/status

4. Test search through LoadBalancer:
   curl "http://localhost:5280/api/Search?query=test&maxResults=5"

5. Verify load distribution (see X-LoadBalancer-Backend header):
   curl -i "http://localhost:5280/api/Search?query=test&maxResults=5"

6. Test failover by stopping one SearchAPI instance and verify LoadBalancer only uses remaining backends.

## COMMANDS AVAILABLE IN CONSOLE SEARCH

- /casesensitive=on/off - Toggle case sensitive search
- /timestamp=on/off - Toggle timestamp display in results
- /results=X or /results=all - Set maximum number of search results to show
- q - Quit the application
